# FIFA World Cup Tip

This project will make use of python and openpyxl to create an automated excel sheet with groups and playoffs for the FIFA World Cup 2022.
The excel sheet should be automated to the extension that the user only has to fill in the result of the matches.

There will be one python file for generating the excel sheet tip and another file for comparing an answer sheet to a correct sheet and calculating the points.
